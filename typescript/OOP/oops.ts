//Programming paradigms: Programming paradigms are fundamental styles or approaches to programming.
//they provide a framework for solving problems & writing programs.
//Different paradigms emphasize various concepts & techniques, guiding how software developers structure & think about their code.

//Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects,
//rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
//OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model real-world entities.

//Benefits of OOP:
//Modularity: Code is organized into reusable classes.
//Reusability: Once created , object & classes can be reused in other programs.
//Scalability: Easy t extend & maintain.

//Key concepts of OOP & 4 Main Pillars of OOP
// Classes (A blue print for creating objects) & Objects  (instance of calss)
// Properties (Characteristics or attributes of an object) & Methods (Actions or behaviours that objects can perform) 
//1. Inheritance :  One property of object is aquiring to another property of object
//2. Polymorphism : Different behaviour at different instances
//3. Encapsulation: Protecting data
//4. Abstraction : Hiding irrelevent data

//Interface: Allows to define the structure or shape of an object & specify the properties & methods that an object has 

interface Person { //interface
    name : string;
    age  : number;
    gender : string;
}
// class
// //class person1: Person = {name: "Ali",
//      age: 20,
//       gender: "male",}
// //inheritance
// class person2 extends person1
